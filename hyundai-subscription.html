        <p class="answers hide-ans">
          Your Hyundai car will be covered by comprehensive insurance, to take
          care of damage cases. In case of damage, your liability would be
          limited to the difference between the costs incurred to repair the
          damage and the proceeds from insurance claim with maximum liability
          limited to INR 10,000. In situations of irresponsible or unsafe or
          negligent usage, there could be discretionary exceptions to this
          policy, whereby you could be liable for all damages irrespective of
          whether we are able to claim insurance in such cases.

        Revv Hyundai subscription – Safe, sanitized and comfortable cars for
        everyday travel
      </h2>
      <p>
        Taking a Revv Hyundai subscription in these times is the smartest
        decision you can take for your family so that you can avoid the hassles
        and unsafe environment of the public transport. While the Hyundai cars
        are well known for their reliability and comfort with a mix of
        cutting-edge features, the Revv subscription of Hyundai cars provide the
        customers with access to the most popular Hyundai models. The cars are
        thoroughly sanitized both inside and outside before the delivery, to
        eliminate any chance of contamination from any surface of the car. The
        Revv team members would also be wearing full Personal Protective
        Equipment (PPE) while delivering the sanitized Hyundai cars for
        subscription by Revv to your doorstep.
      </p>

      <h2>Hyundai subscription by Revv - Makes sense financially</h2>
      <p>
        With the self-drive Hyundai car subscription, you can enjoy your
        favorite Hyundai car without having to commit your money into buying it.
        Hyundai subscription by Revv comes at a reasonable pricing model, so
        that the amount you pay as the rental is lesser than the down-payment,
        EMIs, Insurance, Road Tax and Maintenance amount taken together. All
        these facilities are, however, fully inclusive in the Hyundai
        subscription by Revv. While you save yourself from paying for each of
        the services separately, you can also change to a different car
        make-model later if you get bored of it and decide to go for a different
        car. While the minimum Hyundai subscription India period is 12 months,
        you can reduce this period of subscription and move out of the contract
        anytime by paying a pre closure penalty amount. There is also a buy-out
        option in case you fall in love with the car and decide to buy it.
      </p>

      <h2>Taking Revv Hyundai subscription is as easy as 123</h2>
      <p>
        The Revv Hyundai cars subscription in Bangalore, Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai,
        Hyderabad, Pune and in 18 more cities in India can be taken up in just a
